## Notes During Heath Adam's (The Cyber Mentor) **[Zero to Hero Pentesting](https://www.thecybermentor.com/zero-to-hero-pentesting)** Course.

Most of what is here is just a copy of all that he has done while teaching on his videos, which are already freely available on his website. So I hope there is no copyright issue here.

I am storing them here for a very simple purpose, while I am announcing that one of the purposes is surely not to keep something useful for someone. 

As part of the learning, I was switching back and forth between my native OS and the Kali VM, and note taking was becoming tedious with multiple windows. 

To ensure I can peacefully work and take notes on one large window, that is Kali VM on fullscreen mode, and ensure I don't lose the notes if VM crashed - that's my objective.

> Happy learning to myself! ;-)
