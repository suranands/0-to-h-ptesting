I just started with the **Zero to Hero Pentesting** course on the [*CyberMentor*](https://www.thecybermentor.com/zero-to-hero-pentesting) website.

- Downloaded kali VMware Player Image
- Added the image to VMware player
- Default credentials - kali/kali
- Changed the root password - 94r46477as
- And of course, the most important aspect of today's class is ... I learned to use KeepNote and it is just perfect!

### Screenshot Apps

The trainer recommends Greenshot screenshot taking app. Somebody during the course suggested Flameshot.

> But for now, I am fine with the Windows 10 default Snip&Sketch app.

That's it for now!

### Some more useful resources

- Davy Rogers, a [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCwWkU-DbqsCeVenZ5qMfhA) who trains people on pentesting. There are quite a few free videos. And he maintains a [blog](https://davyrogers.uk/).
